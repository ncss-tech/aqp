\title{Probabalistic Estimation of Soil Depth within Groups}
\usage{
aggregateSoilDepth(
  x,
  groups,
  crit.prob = 0.9,
  name = hzdesgnname(x),
  p = "Cr|R|Cd",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{SoilProfileCollection} object}

\item{groups}{the name of a site-level attribute that defines groups of profiles within a collection}

\item{crit.prob}{probability cuttoff used to determine where the most likely depth to contact will be, e.g. 0.9 translates to 90\% of profiles are shallower than this depth}

\item{name}{horizon-level attribute where horizon designation is stored, defaults to \code{hzdesgnname(x)}}

\item{p}{a REGEX pattern that matches non-soil genetic horizons}

\item{...}{additional arguments to \code{slab}}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} is returned, with as many rows as there are unique group labels, as specified in \code{groups}.
}
\description{
Estimate the most-likely depth to contact within a collection of soil profiles. Consider \code{getSoilDepthClass} followed by group-wise percentile estimation as a faster alternative.
}
\details{
This function computes a probability-based estimate of soil depth by group. If no grouping variable exists, a dummy value can be used to compute a single estimate. The \code{crit.prob} argument sets the critical probability (e.g. 0.9) at which soil depth within a group of profiles is determined. For example, a \code{crit.prob} of 0.95 might result in an estimated soil depth (e.g. 120cm) where 95\% of the profiles (by group) had depths that were less than or equal to 120cm.

\examples{

data(sp1)
depths(sp1) <- id ~ top + bottom
site(sp1) <- ~ group

# set horizon designation in SPC
hzdesgnname(sp1) <- 'name'

aggregateSoilDepth(sp1, 'group', crit.prob = 0.9)

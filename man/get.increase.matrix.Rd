\title{compute pair-wise distances to determine where an attribute increases within
a vertical distance specified}
\usage{
get.increase.matrix(p, attr, threshold.fun, vertical.distance)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{a SoilProfileCollection, containing a single profile}

\item{attr}{horizon attribute name to get the "increase" of}

\item{threshold.fun}{a function that returns the threshold (as a function of
attr); may return a constant single value}

\item{vertical.distance}{the vertical distance (determined from difference
SPC top depth variable) within which increase must be met}
}
\value{
Returns a square logical matrix reflecting where the increase
criteria were met.

\code{get.increase.depths} converts to horizon dop depth by using above
matrix output to determine depths where increase is met.
}
\description{
Uses matrix outer product to determine all pair-wise differences in \code{attr}
for the horizons of \code{p}. Supplies \code{attr} to \code{threshold.fun} to determine the
minimum value criterion to return TRUE in output matrix for an "increase".
Also, computes all pair-wise distances in depth dimension to determine
whether the vertical distance criteria have been met simultaneously with
\code{attr} increase.
}
\details{
This function assumes that the \code{threshold.fun} supplied by the user returns
either a constant or a vector of equal length to its input.

Note that the \code{threshold.fun} result is allowed to contain NA, but that will
result in no output for affected cells.

\code{get.increase.depths} performs the conversion of the square matrix
output of \code{get.increase.matrix} back to horizon top depth for where
criteria were met.
